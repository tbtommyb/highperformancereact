HighPerformanceReact.dev is a collection of tips and tricks to help you write high performance React code.

My name is Tom and I have over seven years' experience building React apps. I also wrote [The Computer Science Book](https://thecomputersciencebook.com), a complete introduction to computer science in one book. It's aimed at self-taught developers who want to understand what's really going on under the hood.

HPR is currently a work in progress. Sections marked "WIP" as to be completed. Development is in public on [Github](https://github.com/tbtommyb/highperformancereact). If you have any suggestions or corrections, please open an issue on Github.

References to the React source code are using commit [`9cdf8a9`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/9cdf8a99edcfd94d7420835ea663edca04237527).

Always remember the rules for writing high performance code:

1. First make the code work.
1. Identify which code is harming performance.
1. Optimise and measure the outcome.

__Do not__ worry about making your code fast before you have it working.
